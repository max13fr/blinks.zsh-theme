# Introduction
This is my customizations on the Blinks theme that comes with Oh My ZSH. It makes the following changes:

  * Reduce prompt to 1 line instead of 2
  * Replace the history counter on the right side of the prompt with the FR date/time.
  * Adds Mercurial support similar to the git support that the original uses.
